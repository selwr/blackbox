## Ideas

plot time series (grayscale diagrammatic graph) as a 3D surface
do the same for sub-band vs phase

plot a plane of best fit
(tangential to global maxima, but it might still work with normal PoBF; being skewed in the correct direction we want it to
be, in relation to the data direction - seeing that the difference in flux intensity between noise and actual pulsars
is so large)

find planar gradient of the two planes

if the gradient is in the same direction (ie both sloped towards negative z, giving that phase is x and flux density
is y), then check the direction they are sloped towards (ie negative/positive z)

if directions are the same, and that they are both sloped negative z, they are then more likely to be pulsars,
showing characteristic parallel 'lines' down each of the graphs

we can then cross-reference these ideas with the DM position (ie where the *single* max is) and if it is a peak or not

then cross-reference with single peak/not a peak p and p-dot graphs

then with p, p-dot, f and f-dot plot and see if 'red' area exists and is restricted to one area

if all of the characteristics do not seem as though they indicate a pulsar, these are likely to be RFI so can be
taken out of the candidates pool immediately, saving lots of time, leaving behind lone pulsars and binary pulsars
-------------------------------
find big O cost

find maths for raw data (phase/sub-band and phase/time) to surface
and then maths for plane of best fit (least cubes regression)
and then maths for planar gradient (including direction)
and then mention about current methods for plotting other graphs from raw data
